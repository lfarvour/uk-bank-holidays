# WHAT EVEN IS BUNTING

Okay, I'll let [Wikipdeia answer what bunting is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunting_(decoration)) for us:

> A bunting is any festive decorations made of fabric, or of plastic, paper or cardboard in imitation of fabric.

Whew, now that we know it's just the wee banners, we can get into the good stuff -- question askin'!
