# But Then There Was Time Now: A Python Project for Cyber Defenders
>This is a python project designed to help cybersecurity defenders learn how to code in Python. It is intended to accompany a talk for the SANS New2Cyber Summit in 2024, should the talk be accepted.

Time is one of the most important concepts for a cyber defender facing an automation task. To know when a thing occurred is to understand its place in the context of the landscape, and as the refrain goes, "one must know a thing to secure a thing."

Not only is time vital for cyber defense automation, it is a pain in the... butt (PITA). This project uses publicly available data, UK Bank Holidays, that is served via an unauthenticated API. The project asks learners to answer various questions 

# Local Development Environment
To get this up and running, folks will at minimum need Python 3.10 installed on their computers. While having Python installed is technically sufficient to write code, it fails to adopt tools and practices that assist modern developers in moving fast and getting things done. 

For this reason, I offer the following listing of my local development technology stack. Getting all of these tools working together takes a bit of time, elbow grease, and plenty of Google searching. Perhaps even asking ChatGPT if you get stuck ;)

In particular, setting up `pyenv virtualenv` (virtual environments) is quite sassy. If you encounter a brick wall while setting up your system, I recommend sticking to `venv` for virtual environment creation and management, as it built in natively to Python core.

| Development Terminology | Recommended Tool | Purpose | Words About It |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Terminal | Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) <br><br>*OR* whatever is native to your Linux/Unix based OS | The terminal is the text-based interface for your computer filesystem. It also runs helpful binaries such as apt/yum/homebrew that allow easy installation of binaries packaged by manufacturers and [load bearing internet people (LBIP)](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8383). | I hope to never become a load bearing internet person (LBIP). |
| Python | Python 3.10 | Python is the number one programming language among cybersecurity folks. While other languages are just as capable, Python is what has taken hold due to its accessibility to both less-deep and deep nerds. | i love snek. |
| PIP | Comes with Python | PIP is the Python package manager. The default install of python uses a remote package manager called PyPi (https://pypi.org/). Organizations often have their own internal remote package management solutions that allow the creation of custom, potentially proprietary, Python packages that do special things. | As a defender, I try to stick to living off the land -- only use Python's built-in packages. The one that I usually compromise for is [the `requests` library](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) because it does all the heavy lifting for web-based communications, whereas built in `urlllib3` requires a lot of work to do what `requests` does natively. |
| Integrated Development Environment (IDE) | Visual Studio Code |  IDE's provide everything a person needs to code stuff. They provide suggestions, lint (i.e. grammar check), run tests, enable debugging, and are just generally helpful development pals. | This free IDE is the best thing Microsoft has ever done for the world. It supports development in just about any language you can think of and allows open source development of extensions<sup>1</sup> that make life even easier |
| Virtual Environment | pyenv virtualenv <br><br> *OR* venv (built into Python base install) | Virtual environments allow developers to create environments for development projects that are separate from the base installation of Python (or any other language). Virtual environments are handy because they ensure that developers can test code using any version of Python they need (e.g. backwards compatibility testing). They also keep the package environments of different projects separate, which ensures that during packaging only minimum necessary packages are included. | Using virtual environments for projects like this one is definitely overkill. However, the process of learning what virtual environments are and how they work is invaluable for when a person is juggling multiple projects with lots of different package requirements, as can quickly happen when code starts flowing. |


<sup>1</sup> Practice safe installation of unknown code. VSCode does not sandbox extensions, and they *can* be used to deliver malware. That being said, extensions are generally signed and attributed, discouraging malicious behavior.
