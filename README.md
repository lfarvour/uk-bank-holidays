### A Python Project for Cyber Defenders

_To be read in David Attenborough's voice_

:clock12: Time: illusion, construct, constraint. :clock1230:

Time is vital to cyber defenders in answering fundamental questions: who, what, when, where, and how. Time is also one of the more challenging human concepts to encode due to time zones, varying representations of time in string form, and its continuous linear rise leading to unusual problems, such as [The Year 2000 Problem (Y2K)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem) or [The 2038 Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem) (or as I like to call it 2Y2K).

Automating data analysis is also vital to cyber defenders, which means writing time-understanding, -comparing, and -manipulating code.

As a longtime cyber defender, learning to manipulate time in code has been one of my greatest ongoing challenges. Accuracy is vital and deeply difficult to achieve.

The purpose of this project is to teach others what it took me a long time to get kind of good at: manipulating time using python scripts and automation. 

In this repository, learners will discover opportunities to both build for themselves and learn from what has already been built. 

> Learners are encouraged to [reach out to me](README.md#contact) with questions, requests for code reviews, or anything else that can help move them along. I will always help when I can, and if I cannot I will strive to connect you with folks who can.

## Your mission, should you choose to accept it...

Using python, create a command line tool which can:
* make an unauthenticated HTTP request to retrieve data
* parse, store, and manipulate the structured data that is returned
* answer various questions that require time manipulation and comparison
* BONUS: create a new data structure that enables better computation
