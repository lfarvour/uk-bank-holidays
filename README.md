### A Python Project for Cyber Defenders


:clock12: Time: illusion, construct, constraint. :clock1230:

Time is vital to cyber defenders in answering the questions who, what, when, where, and how.

It is also one of the most challenging human concept to encode due to time zones, varying representations of time in string form, and its continuous linear rise leading to unusual problems, such as [The Year 2000 Problem (Y2K)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem) or [The 2038 Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem) (or as I like to call it 2Y2K).

The purpose of this project is to provide an educatinoal tool for cyber defenders to teach themselves python using publicly available data that will be predictably available for a long time and which allows inquiry that cares about when things occur so time calculation is required.

## Your mission, should you choose to accept it...

Using python, create a command line tool which can:
* make an unauthenticated HTTP request to retrieve data
* parse the structured data that is returned
* answer various questions that require time manipulation and comparison
* BONUS: create a new data structure that enables better computation in question
